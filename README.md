**Tasks in Java Start and Java OOP level.**<br>

The course will cover Java fundamentals such as Java Core, collections, multithreading,<br>
 OOP, design patterns,basic algorithms and data structures.<br>
## 
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task001" >Task 001</a> -> 1. Read line 1; 2. Read line 2; 3. Read line 3; 4. Print on the screen: 1) S1 + S3; 2) S3 + S2 + S1; 3) S1 + S2 + S3;<br>
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task002" >Task 002</a> -> Write a program that reads a 5-digit number from the keyboard and outputs the numbers it consists of. For example : It reads the number 54698;<br>
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task003" >Task 003</a> -> Write a program that calculates and displays the area of a triangle if its sides are known;<br>
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task004" >Task 004</a> -> Write a program that calculates and displays the length of a circle if its radius is read from the keyboard;<br>
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task005" >Task 005</a> -> Write a program that counts 4 numbers from the keyboard and displays the largest of them;<br>
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task006" >Task 006</a> -> There is a nine-story house with four entrances. The number of the entryway begins with one. There are 4 apartments on one floor. Write a program that gets the number of the apartment from the keyboard, and displays on the screen what floor, what entryway is this apartment. If there is no such apartment in this house, you need to inform the user about it;<br>
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task007" >Task 007</a> -> Determine the number of days in the year that the user enters. A leap year has 366 days, while a normal year has 365 days. Leap years are all years divisible by 4 with the exception of centuries, which are not divisible by 400;<br>
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task008" >Task 008</a> ->  A triangle exists only if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third. Given: a, b, c are the sides of the supposed triangle. Write a program that indicates "whether such a triangle exists or not";<br>
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task009" >Task 009</a> -> There is a circle with center at the origin and radius 4. The user enters the coordinates of the point x and y from the keyboard. Write a program that determines whether this point lies within the circle or not;<br>
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task010" >Task 010</a> -> This triangle has coordinates of vertices A(0,0), B(4,4), C(6,1). The user enters the coordinates of the points x and y on the keyboard. Write a program that determines whether this point lies within the triangle or not;<br>
##
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task011" >Task 011</a> -> A four-digit number is given. Check if it is a "lucky ticket". A lucky ticket is a number in which - with an even number of digits in the number, the sum of digits in its left half is equal to the sum of digits in its right half. For example, 1322. (1+3 = 2 + 2);<br>
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task012" >Task 012</a> -> A six-digit number is entered from the keyboard. Check to see if it is a palindrome. Note: A palindrome is a number, word, or text that reads equally from left to right and right to left. For example, the numbers are 143341, 5555, 7117, etc.;<br>
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task013" >Task 013</a> -> Use cycles to draw the "wallpaper". And the number of strips must be entered from the keyboard;<br>
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task014" >Task 014</a> -> Use the loop to calculate the factorial of the number - n entered from the keyboard (4 < n < 16). The factorial of a number is the product of all numbers from that number to 1. For example 5!=5*4*3*2*1=120;<br>
