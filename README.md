The factorial of a number is the product of all numbers from that number to 1. For example 5!=5*4*3*2*1=120;<br>
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task015" >Task 015</a> -> Print the multiplication table by 5;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks/tree/main/src/com/task017" >Task 017</a> -> Use loops to display all prime numbers from 1 to 100. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by one or by itself. The first prime numbers are 2,3,5,7...;<br>

 of this sequence (or a similar one). For example,
 the user enters the string 0,2,4,6,8,10,12
 and the answer should be 14.;<br>
Task 029 -> A palindrome number reads the same on both
sides (right to left and left to right).
The largest palindrome number obtained by multiplying
two two two-digit numbers is -9009 = 91 x 99.
Find the largest palindrome obtained by multiplying two three-digit numbers.;<br>
Task 030 -> There is an array {1,2,3,4,5} - the size of the array can be arbitrary.
Write a program that will display all possible combinations of these numbers.
Note that there should be no repeats.;<br>

Task 031 -> Write a program that returns the number of milliseconds
that have elapsed from the same number, but last month to
today's date. For example, if today is August 3,
find out how many milliseconds have passed since July 3.;<br>

Convert it to decimal and display it on the screen ("10" -> 2).;<br>
Task 034 -> Print 10 lines with the value of pi on the screen.
The first line should have 2 decimal places, the second 3,
the third 4, etc.;<br>
Task 035 -> Enter the date from the console. Compare it with the current
date in the system. Print the different parts (year, month)
on the screen.;<br>
Task 036 -> The Hamming distance between two binary numbers
is the number of positions where the bits differ.
Given two positive integers (M, M) in decimal form.
You need to calculate the Hamming distance between these two numbers.;<br>

directories that "lie" in the directory which will be
the parameter of this method.;<br>
Task 040 -> Read from a text file the text in English and print
statistics on the frequency of use of letters in the text
(i.e. letter - number of uses), with the letters used
most often being displayed first.;<br>
Task 041 -> Write a method for creating an ASCII-art in a file,
i.e. a 40x40 character figure filled with characters
that form a pattern.;<br>
